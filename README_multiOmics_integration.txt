In order to integration two Omics data, I created two basic variant autoencoder(VAE) model, one using pytorch, another using tensorflow.

I've created a comprehensive PyTorch implementation for integrating your RNAseq and metagenomic data using a VAE. 
script: multiOmics_integration_pt_v1.py
Here's a walkthrough of the key components in PyTorch:
Architecture Overview

Dual Encoding Branches:
Separate encoder pathways for RNAseq and metagenomic data
Encoder networks with batch normalization and dropout for regularization

Joint Latent Space:
Combines information from both data types into a unified representation
Uses the reparameterization trick for VAE sampling
Encodes both data types into a compact latent space of customizable dimension 

Dual Decoding Branches:
Separate decoders for reconstructing each data type
Allows joint learning of patterns across both datasets

Key Features of the Implementation
Data Preprocessing: Converts AnnData objects to PyTorch tensors and handles train/test splits
Customizable Architecture: Adjustable hidden and latent dimensions
Comprehensive Loss Function: Balances reconstruction accuracy with latent space regularization
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key features from both datasets
Visualization Tools: For inspecting latent space and training progress
Adaptable to Your Data: Works with any paired multi-omics data in AnnData format
Complete Pipeline: From preprocessing to feature importance analysis


To Use This Implementation
Load your RNAseq and metagenomic datasets as AnnData objects
Make sure both AnnData objects have the same observation names (samples) in the same order
Call the run_multi_omics_integration function with your data


#For tensorflow script, its implementation hightlights:
#The usage is very similar to the PyTorch version.
#script: multiOmics_integration_tf_v1.py 
Model Structure:
Uses the Keras Model class with custom training and testing steps
Defines custom Sampling layer for the reparameterization trick
Uses the Sequential API for encoder and decoder networks


Training Process:
Implements custom train_step and test_step methods for more control
Uses TensorFlow datasets for efficient data loading
Includes metric tracking built into the model


Additional Features:
Custom BetaScheduler callback for KL annealing during training
More comprehensive loss plotting with separate panels for each loss component
Built-in early stopping and learning rate reduction


#For multiOmics_integration_pt_v2.py, I added one more feature selection setting, loosing feature selection threshold, feature important cross 50% of samples would be selected. 

So the v2 script contain new feature importance analysis. 
The updated code now calculates feature importance in two ways:

Global importance (from model weights) - This captures the overall contribution of each feature to the reconstructions.
Sample-specific importance - This analyzes how each feature's importance varies across individual samples by:

Computing gradients from each reconstructed feature back to the latent space
Identifying features that are in the top 25% of importance for each sample
Selecting features that are important in at least 50% of samples (configurable threshold)

Key Changes
Enhanced Feature Importance Function
Performs gradient-based sensitivity analysis for each sample
Tracks which features are consistently important across samples
Combines global weight-based importance with sample-level importance
Returns both importance scores and binary selection masks

Improved Visualization
Shows both the selected features and overall top features
Compares selected vs. non-selected features in the display
Provides statistics on how many features were selected

Updated Integration Pipeline
Added parameter to customize the selection threshold (default: 50%)
Stores importance scores and selection results in the AnnData objects
Returns lists of selected feature names for easy use in downstream analyses 

Benefits of This Approach
This approach offers several advantages:

More Robust Features: By requiring importance across multiple samples, you filter out features that might be important in only a few samples but not generalizable.
Better Biological Insights: Features consistently important across samples are more likely to represent genuine biological patterns rather than technical noise.
Efficient Downstream Analysis: The selected features can be directly used for further analysis, reducing dimensionality while keeping the most relevant information.
More Complete Understanding: The visualization now shows you both globally important features and those that are consistently important across samples.


#For multiOmics_integration_pt_v3.py, I added one more setting, more complex scenario, integrate data contains clinical metadata. 
Integrate sample metadata into the model to make it more clinically relevant and insightful. I'll update the code to incorporate clinical variables like cancer stage, age, diagnosis age, and drug response into both the analysis and visualization.

significantly enhanced the PyTorch VAE implementation to integrate clinical metadata with RNAseq and metagenomic data. The updated model can now handle cancer stage information, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes as part of a comprehensive multi-omics analysis framework.

****EVALUATION
Evaluating the performance of a multi-omics VAE model with clinical integration requires a multi-faceted approach because the model serves several purposes simultaneously. Here are the key metrics you should consider:
1. Unsupervised Learning Metrics
Reconstruction Quality
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures how well the model reconstructs the original -omics data
Correlation: Pearson/Spearman correlation between original and reconstructed features

Latent Space Quality
Silhouette Score: Measures how well samples from different clinical groups separate in latent space
UMAP/t-SNE Visualization: Qualitative assessment of cluster separation by clinical variables
Latent Space Entropy: Quantifies how evenly samples distribute in latent space

2. Supervised Learning Metrics
Cancer Stage Prediction
Accuracy: Overall correct classification rate
Confusion Matrix: Detailed view of prediction errors between stages
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall (important for imbalanced stages)
Ordinal Accuracy: Accounts for the ordered nature of stages (e.g., predicting stage II for stage III is better than predicting stage I)

Drug Response Prediction
AUC-ROC: Area under the ROC curve - standard for binary classification
Precision-Recall Curve: More informative than ROC for imbalanced response data
Balanced Accuracy: Accounts for imbalance between responders/non-responders

3. Feature Selection Metrics
Selected Feature Evaluation
Stability: Consistency of selected features across multiple runs or cross-validation
Biological Enrichment: Enrichment of selected features in relevant pathways
Literature Validation: Presence of known biomarkers in selected features

Stage-Specific Features
Differential Importance: Statistical significance of differences in feature importance across stages
Jaccard Index: Measure of overlap between feature sets from different stages

4. Comparative Performance
External Validation
Hold-out Test Set Performance: All metrics evaluated on data not used during training
Cross-Validation: K-fold validation to ensure robustness

Comparative Analysis
Baseline Comparison: Compare with simpler models (PCA, standard VAE without clinical data)
Ablation Study: Compare performance with and without different components (e.g., without drug response prediction)

5. Implementation Metrics
Cross-Correlation Analysis: Between selected RNAseq and metagenomic features
Clinical Association: Statistical tests for association between latent dimensions and clinical variables
Classification from Selected Features: Performance of standard classifiers using only the selected features
