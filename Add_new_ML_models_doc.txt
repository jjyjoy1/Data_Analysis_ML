Model Details and Benefits
Survival Models:
CoxNet (original, cnet): Penalized Cox regression with elastic net regularization
Good for identifying critical features with regularization
Works well with high-dimensional data


Random Survival Forest (rsf):
Can capture non-linear relationships and interactions
Less sensitive to outliers and doesn't require feature normalization
Provides feature importance measures


Survival SVM (svm):
Good performance in high-dimensional data
Can be more stable than Cox models for some datasets
Rank-based formulation focuses on order of events

Drug Response Models:
RFE-SVM (original, rfe): Recursive feature elimination with SVM
Good for selecting an optimal feature subset
Works well with highly correlated features


Logistic Regression (original, lgr): Elastic net regularized logistic regression
Interpretable with weighted coefficients
Regularization helps with feature selection


Limma/EdgeR (original, limma/edger): Differential expression based approach
Good for feature selection with biological relevance
Takes into account expression variance


Random Forest (rf):
Robust to overfitting, especially with small sample sizes
Can handle non-linear relationships
Provides feature importance metrics


Gradient Boosting (gb):
Often provides superior predictive performance
Robust to outliers and missing data
Good balance of bias and variance

These models provide a comprehensive set of options that can be compared to find the best approach for your specific dataset characteristics.

RNA-seq Specific Preprocessing:

EdgeR-based Preprocessing Pipeline:

The code uses EdgeR-specific preprocessing steps for RNA-seq data:

EdgeRFilterByExpr: Filters out low-expressed genes
EdgeRTMMLogCPM: Performs log-CPM normalization with TMM normalization


Differential Expression Analysis:

For feature selection, the RNA-seq pipelines use either:

EdgeR: For RNA-seq data-specific differential expression analysis
Limma: An alternative method applicable to RNA-seq data after normalization
